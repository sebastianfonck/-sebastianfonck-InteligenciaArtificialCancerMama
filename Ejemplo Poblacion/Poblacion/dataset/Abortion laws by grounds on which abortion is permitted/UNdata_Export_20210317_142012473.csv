"fnSeqID","Footnote"
"1","The abortion laws in these countries do not expressly allow abortions to be performed to save the life of the woman, but general principles of criminal legislation allow abortions to be performed for this reason on the ground of necessity."
"2","Abortion law is determined at the state level and is governed by various state laws and, in some states, court decisions. The most restrictive laws allow abortion to be performed to save the life of the woman and to preserve her physical and mental health; one state with the most liberal law allows abortion on request."
"3","The abortion laws in these countries have been amended to remove all indications relevant to the legal performance of abortions; however, it is not clear whether a defense of necessity might be allowed to justify an abortion performed to save the life of the woman."
"4","The abortion laws in these countries either expressly allow abortions to be performed only to save the life of the woman, or are governed by general principles of criminal legislation which allow abortions to be performed for this reason on the ground of necessity. In addition, the British case of R. v. Bourne or local application of that decision apply. Under the decision, the ground of necessity was interpreted to encompass abortion performed on physical and mental grounds."
"5","Refers to the Vatican City State."
"6","The penal code makes no exceptions to the general prohibition on the performance of abortions; the Code of Medical Ethics, however, allows abortions to be performed for therapeutic purposes."
"7","The law contains no specific reference to abortions performed on grounds of mental health or in the case of foetal impairment. However, since the law allows abortions for economic or social reasons, mental health and foetal impairment are presumably covered by this ground."
"8","Abortion law is determined at the state level. The grounds checked refer only to the Federal Penal Code; some states allow abortions to be performed on the following grounds: to preserve physical health, to preserve mental health, in the case of foetal impairment, and for economic or social reasons."
"9","Nigeria has two abortion laws: one for the northern states and one for the southern states. Both laws specifically allow abortions to be performed to save the life of the woman. In addition, in the southern states, the decision of R. v. Bourne is applied, which allows abortions to be performed for physical and mental health reasons."
"10","The law allows abortion to be performed to save the life of the woman or to provide necessary treatment. The law does not indicate which abortions constitute necessary treatment."
"11","Refers to the abortion law of England and Wales and Scotland."
